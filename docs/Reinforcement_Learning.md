Chemical experimental manipulations are often continuous processes, making RL an essential tool for integrating chemistry experiments with robotic simulation. IsaacGym is a well-regarded simulation environment specifically designed to support robot learning. The Omniverse Isaac Gym Reinforcement Learning (OmniIsaacGymEnvs) for Isaac Sim repository provides RL examples compatible with IsaacSim and has become a widely adopted environment for RL research. 

To run RL tasks in Chemistry3Dï¼Œyou could install OmniIsaacGymEnvs first. Please refer to [OmniIsaacGymEnvs](https://github.com/isaac-sim/OmniIsaacGymEnvs).

**PLEASE NOTE:** Version 4.0.0 will be the last release of OmniIsaacGymEnvs. Moving forward, OmniIsaacGymEnvs will be merging with [IsaacLab](https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab). All future updates will be available as part of the IsaacLab repository.

For tutorials on migrating to IsaacLab, please visit: [IsaacLab Migration Guide](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/source/migration/migrating_from_omniisaacgymenvs.html).

If you want to run our RL example, please copy our files in **Reinforcement_Learning** to corresponding place in **OmniIsaacGymEnvs**.
